### Jupyter Notebook

Feel freee to mess around with different configurations. You can choose the number of consumers you want in the network, and you can create as many agents of different types as you want. Make sure for each agent you also generate a new action space for them. Please refer to the notebooks example inside the Jupyter notebook. Modify the threshold as you see fit for the fact checker agent.
