This project aims to model and analyze the evolution of opinions within a social network when influenced by misinformation. We will leverage reinforcement learning to train agents to resemble the general public, malicious misinformation spreaders, and fact-checkers to understand the role each plays in facilitating opinion dynamics. By simulating these social interactions, the underlying impact of accurate and misleading information can be revealed. This is significant as it addresses critical challenges in today's digital age, where misinformation can rapidly spread across social media platforms, impacting both public opinion and decision-making processes. 

Our motivation stems from applying reinforcement learning to a pressing real-world issue. The social discourse and political polarization from misinformation could have a detrimental effect on real-world decisions. As a result, we hope our project will provide some insight on how fact-checkers can effectively counter misinformation and influence opinion dynamics. This in turn will result in better algorithms or policies for combating the spread of misinformation.
